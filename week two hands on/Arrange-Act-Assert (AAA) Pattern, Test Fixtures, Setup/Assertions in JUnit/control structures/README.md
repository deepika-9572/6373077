2. Connect to your Oracle database.

## ‚úÖ Output

If the `Loans` and `Customers` tables contain the following sample data:

### Customers Table:

| CustomerID | Name         |
|------------|--------------|
| 1          | John Doe     |
| 2          | Jane Smith   |

### Loans Table:

| LoanID | CustomerID | DueDate    |
|--------|------------|------------|
| 101    | 1          | (SYSDATE+5)|
| 102    | 2          | (SYSDATE+40)|

After running the script, only loans due within 30 days will trigger reminders.

### Sample Output:
Reminder: Dear John Doe, your loan (LoanID: 101) is due on 01-JUL-2025.


‚û°Ô∏è The loan for Jane Smith is not printed because it is due beyond 30 days.

## üìù Notes

- Make sure `DBMS_OUTPUT` is turned ON to see the output.
- Adjust the `SYSDATE + 30` interval in the query if a different window is needed.
- Both `Loans` and `Customers` tables must exist with proper data.
